      <h3>A Series Of Coincidences... Or Fate?</h3>
      <p>
        Friday, August 23rd, 2019. After a few months of taking a break from
        dating Mateen, on a whim, installs the Plenty of Fish app again, feeling
        the urge to take another look and see who's out there. He looks through
        some profiles and decides to expand his search this time, including
        profiles from Toronto. He comes across a couple that interest him,
        including an anime nerd from Brampton. "Ugh... Toronto..." he thinks to
        himself, before deciding this girl was cute, had shared interests, and
        had good values based on her bio. He sends her a message. No cheesy pick
        up lines, he just asks if she attended Fan Expo, where he'd been earlier
        that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mateen picks up his phone again on Saturday. "Yeah... time to delete
        this thing again" he tells himself. He had cast only a few lines, but
        gotten no bites. Phone in hand, he gets distracted, starts to feel lazy
        about going through the process to delete his account, and decides,
        "naaa... I'll do it tomorrow".
      </p>
      <p>
        It's Sunday, August 25th now. Mateen is sitting at his computer desk,
        and suuddenly gotten the strong urge to finally delete the app and his
        account. "Okay, this is it", he tells himself. He picks the phone up to
        delete POF and... curious... a message. The cute girl from Toronto,
        Sasha (who would soon correct him that Brampton is, in fact, not
        Toronto), had replied. He felt like he should at least be polite and
        message back, waiting for it to fail organically before being done with
        it.
      </p>

      <h3>When Does It Crash And Burn?</h3>
      <p>
        Messages flow between Sasha and Mateen. They talk daily. They have deep
        conversations, and share light hearted jokes. They talk about their
        favourite things, share some personal memories. Talk about goals, plans,
        and values. Mateen keeps waiting for the moment where it all goes bad,
        his cynicism nurtured by bad experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile Sasha continues taking the lead and pushing the budding
        interest between them forward. They move off POF and message on
        Instagram instead at her request. Eventually they share Facebook
        accounts and message on there too. Then Snapchat. Messages on every
        platform. She asks to play 21 Questions so that they get to know each
        other better. He's still waiting for the hammer to drop, not allowing
        himself to feel optimism about this incredible person who was so
        interested in getting to know him. She was becoming more and more
        intrigued by this cute boy sending thoughtful messages and offering
        genuine conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, she asks him to meet in person, on a date. Schedules are tough
        because Mateen has a busy month, but they make it work and meet at
        Boston Pizza in Brampton. It was the only opportunity to meet before he
        went away for a while to visit his brother in Calgary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day of the first meeting arrives and Mateen is getting ready.
        Something tells him to wear a tie. It's an odd feeling; never had he
        worn a tie before on a first date, but it almost felt like something
        compelled him to do so. He grabs his tie and a dress shirt. What's the
        point of a gut if you don't listen to it?
      </p>
      <p>
        He arrives at Boston Pizza before Sasha, so he paces and waits. Shortly
        after she too arrives and sees the cute boy she'd been talking to online
        standing there, in a tie, and thinks to herself, "Oh wow he looks so
        snazzy!". She steps out of the car to greet him and he's shocked... she
        looked way better than her pictures in person, and she was gorgeous in
        her pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
        They head inside and sit down. A strange request is made. Her mom wants
        to talk to him on the phone before the date starts. He feels a bit weird
        about it, but this girl was worth it and he appreciated a protective
        parent, so he agreed. The call goes well and the date begins. She orders
        noodles, he orders pizza. She talks a mile a minute about any and
        everything, going off on tangents and then tangents to those tangents,
        and he stares at her lovestruck, taking it all in. The perfect prologue
        to their relationship.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>A Lovesick Puppy</h3>
      <p>
        Before the first date ended they already decided to meet again. Once he
        gets home, Mateen messages everybody. How on earth did he find somebody
        this amazing, and why the heck was she interested in him?! It didn't
        matter, he was too happy, too excited. It would hurt when this one
        crashed and burned, he knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it never crashed, and never burned. Dates continued to come. He
        trusted her to take him down a weird murder path behind a restaurant,
        and she didn't feel weirded out holding his hand. He knocked an item off
        the bucket list by taking her hand after a date and surprising her by
        giving it a kiss... but she misunderstood his intentions and really made
        it hard for him. They kept talking every day. When Sasha needed help
        with homework, Mateen drove to Brampton after work to help her until
        midnight every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon enough he started sleeping over, then more often, then spent most
        of his time there. They woke up together in the morning and he would
        take her to work before driving to Burlington for his own job, then he
        would come back after to see her again. When he had to be in Hamilton,
        he left the house at 6am so that he could pick her up and take her to
        work when she didn't have a ride, all to spare her the cost of an Uber.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was in love. So was she. He said it out loud first, she giggled and
        said thanks. He found out later that she had been telling her friend she
        loved him before he'd even said it, which he continues to tease her with
        to this day. She eventually told him later before a date to Ripley's
        Aquarium that she loved him too. Overjoyed, Mateen bought her one of the
        biggest stuffed animals at their gift shop, Wally the Narwhal, another
        item checked off the bucket list.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship becomes official in December, months after everyone
        considered them a couple. She has a major surgery and Mateen takes a few
        days off work to take her to the hospital and take care of her while she
        recovers. Afterwards they continue spending nearly all their time
        together, and she would always ask him to stay longer when it was time
        to leave. He gave in most of the time and barely saw his own family,
        which they definitely teased him for. Eventually she would come with him
        whenever he went back home to Hamilton, and he would go with her when
        she went back home to Brampton. They were living together without really
        living together, and neither could be happier.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all this time spent together, all these feelings he'd never known
        before, Mateen knew that this was it, she was the one. They had spoken
        of marriage, and of him proposing. Sasha had already picked out the
        ring. They were planning to move in together in September officially
        when she went back to college, but he wanted to pop the question
        beforehand. He needed a plan though, something to make this special and
        unique to them. He wanted her to have a keepsake to remember it by,
        something she said she wanted. He started planning a few months in
        advance, asking Sasha each day to tell him some things she loved about
        herself.
      </p>

      <h3>He Better Propose At The End Of This...</h3>
      <p>
        The weeks passed and the list grew. Everything was in place. He bought a
        journal, pink of course to suit her tastes, and began working in secret
        while she was asleep. He had 100 reasons to love Sasha, according to
        Sasha herself, and handwrote them into the journal, interspersing them
        with pictures to celebrate their first year in each other's lives. This
        was it, he knew, this was how he would do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        July 31st, 2020. Today is the day. Tomorrow their families were meeting,
        so he would do it tonight. He hides the ring, hides the book. He had
        already coordinated what she would be wearing and knew a few days in
        advance. It was part of the last surprise. He brings out the finished
        book and sits with her as she reads it. The tears flow freely, emotions
        growing stronger with each turn of the page. She thinks to herself, "he
        better propose to me at the end of this". Oh, he will, don't you worry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally she gets to the last page, and the last surprise. It was a
        picture he had drawn of the two of them, perfectly coordinated with the
        outfits they were wearing in that exact moment, every detail perfect,
        from her hair to her slippers. In the picture Mateen is proposing to the
        girl he could never have even dreamt of finding, the love of his life
        and the person he wants to grow old with. She's bawling as he slips out
        the ring and gets down on one knee in front of her, choking up and
        barely able to get the words out...
