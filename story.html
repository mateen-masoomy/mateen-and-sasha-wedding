      <h3>A Series Of Coincidences... Or Fate?</h3>
      <p>
        Late July, 2019. Sasha is encouraged to give online dating another try
        and installs the Plenty of Fish app again. Her brother, Sean, recommends
        that she widens her search outside of Brampton. "Okay, we'll see how it
        goes" she thinks, deciding to give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
        Friday, August 23rd, 2019. A few months into a break from dating,
        Mateen, on a whim, installs the Plenty of Fish app again. He decides to
        expand his search this time, including profiles from Toronto. He comes
        across an anime nerd from Brampton. "Ugh... Toronto...", but this girl
        was cute, had shared interests, and had good values so he sends her a
        message. No cheesy pick up lines, he just asks if she attended Fan Expo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mateen picks up his phone again on Saturday to delete the app. He had
        only cast a few lines, but gotten no bites. Phone in hand, he gets
        distracted before feeling lazy and deciding, "naaa... I'll do it
        tomorrow".
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunday, August 25th, 2019. Sasha sees the message from Mateen. The first
        thing she notices are his eyes and his smile. "So cute", she thinks to
        herself. She decides to reply. Around this time, Mateen suddenly has the
        urge to delete the app again, but he's stopped by a notification... a
        message. The cute girl from Toronto, Sasha (who would soon correct him
        that Brampton is, in fact, not Toronto), had replied. He felt like he
        should be polite and message back rather than delete the app.
      </p>

      <h3>When Does It Crash And Burn?</h3>
      <p>
        Messages flow between Sasha and Mateen. They talk daily, having both
        deep conversations and light hearted exchanges. Mateen, ever the cynic,
        keeps waiting for the moment where it all goes bad. Sasha, meanwhile, is
        hopeful but nervous, trying to take things slow. As time goes on,
        however, her feelings grow stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        She takes the lead in pushing the budding interest between them forward.
        They share Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat accounts to share pictures
        and messages on every platform. She asks to play 21 Questions so that
        they get to know each other better. She becomes more and more intrigued
        by this cute boy sending thoughtful messages and offering genuine
        conversation, showing his pictures off to friends and family before
        finally asking to meet in person for a date at Boston Pizza in
        Mississauga.
      </p>
      <p>
        September 14th, 2019. The day of the first meeting arrives and Mateen is
        getting ready. Something tells him to wear a tie. It's an odd feeling;
        he'd never worn a tie before on a first date, but he felt compelled to
        do so. He grabs his tie and a dress shirt. What's the point of a gut if
        you don't listen to it?
      </p>
      <p>
        He arrives before Sasha, so he paces and waits. Shortly after, she too
        arrives and sees the cute boy she'd been talking to online in a tie,
        thinking to herself, "Oh wow he looks so snazzy!". She steps out of the
        car to greet him and he's shocked... she was gorgeous in her pictures
        but looked way better in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting at their table a strange request is made: her mom asks to talk
        to him on the phone. The girl was cute and he appreciated a protective
        parent, so he agreed. Awkward phone call over, she orders noodles, he
        orders pizza. She talks a mile a minute about any and everything, going
        off on tangents and then tangents to those tangents, and he stares at
        her lovestruck, taking it all in. The perfect prologue to their
        relationship.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>A Lovesick Puppy</h3>
      <p>
        Once he gets home, Mateen messages everybody. How on earth was this
        amazing girl interested in him?! It didn't matter, he was too happy, too
        excited. They continue to date, each better than the last. He attempts
        to complete a lifelong goal, surprising her by taking her hand giving it
        a kiss... but she misunderstands his intentions, making it awkward and
        difficult. They laugh it off. The two continue talking every day, and
        when Sasha needs help with homework, he drives to Brampton after work to
        help her until midnight every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon enough he starts sleeping over. The second time, Sasha decides to
        sneak attack him. Before they fall asleep, while he's mid-sentence, she
        lunges in and gives him a quick kiss before rolling over and away,
        tactically retreating. Mateen lays there a while, stunned. From then on
        he spent most of his time in Brampton. In the morning he would take her
        to work before driving to Burlington for his own job, then come back
        after. When he had to be in Hamilton, he left the house at 6:00am to
        head over and take her to work to spare her the cost of an Uber.
      </p>

      <p>
        November 13th, 2019. He's in love. So is she. He says it out loud first
        while dropping her off at work, to which she giggles and says thanks. No
        bother, he knew she would. She tells him 3 days later she loves him too
        before a date to Ripley's Aquarium, explaining she had also been falling
        in love but was nervous to express it, worrying she was moving too fast.
        Overjoyed, Mateen buys her one of the biggest stuffed animals at their
        gift shop, Wally the Narwhal (who still guards their couch today).
      </p>
      <p>
        December 22nd, 2019, the relationship becomes official, months after
        everyone considered them a couple. She has a major surgery a few weeks
        later and Mateen takes nearly a week off work to take her to the
        hospital and take care of her while she recovers. Afterwards they
        continue spending nearly all their time together. He barely sees his own
        family, which they tease him for continuously. Eventually she starts to
        come home with him to Hamilton, and he then returns to Brampton with
        her. They are living together without really living together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mateen knows this is it, she's the one. They speak of marriage, and of
        him proposing. Sasha picks out a ring, rose gold with pink sapphire.
        Planning to officially move in together in September when she goes to
        college, he decides he would pop the question beforehand. He needs a
        plan though, something special and unique to them. He starts planning a
        few months in advance, asking Sasha each day to tell him what she loves
        about herself.
      </p>

      <h3>He Better Propose At The End Of This...</h3>
      <p>
        Weeks pass and everything is in place. He buys a journal, pink of
        course, and begins working in secret. 100 reasons to love Sasha,
        according to Sasha herself, handwritten into the journal, interspersed
        with pictures to celebrate their first year. This is how he would do it,
        he knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        July 31st, 2020. Tomorrow their families would meet, so he would do it
        tonight. He had already coordinated their outfits in advance. It was
        part of the last surprise. That night, he presents the finished book and
        sits with her as she reads it. Tears flow freely and emotions grow
        stronger with each page. She thinks to herself, "he better propose to me
        at the end of this".
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, she gets to the last page, and the last surprise: a picture he
        had drawn of them, perfectly coordinated with the outfits they were
        wearing in that exact moment, every detail perfect from her hair to her
        slippers, his shirt to his socks. In the picture, Mateen is proposing to
        the girl he could never have even dreamt of finding, the love of his
        life. She's bawling as he slips out the ring and gets down on one knee
        in front of her, choking up and barely able to get the words out...
