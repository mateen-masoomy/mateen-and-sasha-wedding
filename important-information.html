      <h3>Late Arrivals</h3>
      <p>
        We request that anyone arriving after 11:50am please follow the
        designated paths to enter the seating area. The entrance will be lead
        into a curtained off section of the hall to facilitate an aisle
        entrance, and guests arriving immediately before and during the ceremony
        are requested to enter the seating area via the sides of the curtained
        pathway rather than the main aisle entrance.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Dietary Restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        Due to religious dietary restrictions, we will not be serving pork
        during the event. For any other dietary restrictions, please include the
        necessary information in your RSVP survey.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Music played at the event will be a mix of radio friendly dance music,
        Jamaican music, and Afghan music. We encourage our guests to participate
        in dancing, and are requesting that there be no song requests for our DJ
        during the event.
      </p>

      <h3>Wedding Gifts</h3>
      <p>
        For our guests who would like to bring a wedding gift, we are planning
        to move to Regina, Saskatchewan, within the year and would like to
        request a gift of money where possible to ease the burden of moving. It
        will be difficult to pack all our things into a truck as is, and this
        would go a great way towards making the move easier on us. We apologize
        for any inconviences and thank you for understanding.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Alcohol</h3>
      <p>
        We are requesting that our wedding is a sober wedding. We do not plan to
        serve alcohol during the event for religious reasons.
